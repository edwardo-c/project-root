# POS Xref Pipeline

This project is designed to safely extract key customer data from Master POS (point of sale) Excel files stored on a shared network.  
It's part of a larger internal tooling effort to standardize and automate cross-referencing of POS customer name variations and linking back to direct customers.

> **Problem this solves**:  
> *How much has customer X purchased through direct AND POS (distributors' supplied data)?*
